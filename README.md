# SeaLife-project
Personal project. Training with bootstrap 3 and materializeCSS (fusion of both)

Sealife is a personal project that has been done to learn three frameworks. I had seen a little bit Bootstrap and I wanted to create a fusion of Bootstrap, MaterializeCSS and Material Design Lite to see if it was possible. I also chose a subject that I liked to make the creation of the website even more fun. (100% responsive)
